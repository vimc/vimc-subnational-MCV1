the impact of routine measles immunisation in Africa

This repository contains the code used to process the coverage estimates and impact estimates and produce the figures shown in the manuscript.


## orderly

This is an [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) project.  The directories are:

* `src`: create new reports here
* `archive`: versioed results of running your report
* `data`: copies of data used in the reports

## Running the reports

Running the reports is unfortunately not possible as running requires access to a PostgreSQL database which contains sensitive information. However, all report running inputs and outputs are contained within the archive folder.
